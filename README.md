## My process
### Built with

- Html
- CSS
- googlefonts



### What I learned

- I learned how to add and adjust viewports using media query in css. 
- I also learned how to effectively use the chrome developer tools to adjust and have accuracy in your codes.
- I also had a better understanding of how to do the hover and active state for elements



### Continued development

Some areas i had difficulty with are:
- using svg image for background. This proved really difficult for me. I am not completely comfortable with using it and would further practice more on it.
- I also had difficulty in making the viewport for mobile and desktop state responsive. 




### Useful resources

- [Mozilla developers network](https://www.developer.mozilla.org) - This site helped me in checking for elements that would enhance my coding and further have responsive design. 
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This also aided me in several areas more especially on my adapting in the css interface.
